SP Title Filler 1.0.0
=====================

SP Title Filler is a simple fieldtype that automatically fills in your title field with the channel name and an incrementing integer, allowing you to safely hide the title field from your clients without fearing validation concerns. Because, frankly, sometimes you just *don't need a title*.

Installation
============

Install SP Title Filler like any other ExpressionEngine 2 add-on. Simply drag the third_party/sp_title_filler/ folder found in your download into the system/expressionengine/third_party/ folder. Then, go into the EE control panel, navigate to the Fieldtypes page, find SP Title Filler and hit Install.

Usage
=====

To auto-fill a channel's title field, just add an SP Title Filler field to your custom fields for that channel and the title field will be automatically filled. This is all very rudimentary currently... In the future I'd like to expand this to custom fields, custom filling formats and such, but right now you'll have to make do with titles :).
